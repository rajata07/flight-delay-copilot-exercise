---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Local Setup

### Local Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajata07/flight-delay-copilot-exercise.git
cd flight-delay-copilot-exercise
```

---

### Local Step 2: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

Or: Open VS Code → File → Open Folder → Select the cloned folder

---

### Local Step 3: Install GitHub Copilot Extension

1. Click the **Extensions** icon in VS Code sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for **"GitHub Copilot"**
3. Click **Install** on "GitHub Copilot" (by GitHub)
4. Also install **"GitHub Copilot Chat"**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Copilot not suggesting code?</b></summary>

1. Check you're signed into GitHub in VS Code
2. Verify your Copilot license is active
3. Reload VS Code window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window")
4. Check the Copilot icon in the status bar (bottom right)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Python packages not installing?</b></summary>

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.8+)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can't find the cloned folder?</b></summary>

1. Check your terminal's current directory: `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows)
2. The clone creates a folder named `flight-delay-hackathon` in your current directory
